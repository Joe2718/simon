accordion div = "soundURL" 
first key from object and create H3 with the 
	name: value 
	files: [] that will fill the keys 
	make a loop that reads all the files and creates tiny divs 
	with class of .tonekeys white back ground 


************************************************
Things left to do:
OPTIONS needs a close trigger other than clicking the tab again.  
Make an X, position it in upper right corner, maybe a red background 
	add .menu class to it.  

Add TONES  .. I'm really not sure if I'm going to continue with this.  I've overkilled Simon plenty enough already.  
I still feel like I might need to scale up the center part a bit.  

If I add Tones than I'll have to make the sound options accordion style or fill screen with it.  
	I should add them AND make options accoridion just for the practice.
