Simon using JS, midi and clickable borders

Despite the awesomely terrible first commit desription, playing a midi file works.  It just isn't fluid enough for my purposes.  
The clickable borders I might expand into a general purpose tool and that's got it start here as well.  
This is more just trying to get some practice with Git as embarassing as this is.  
I'm glad Git Hub made this new repo idiotproof.  
My plans for this is still use the midi but find somehow to do a 'note'.  So once this is done; I'll have the ability to build 
a midi keyboard.  2017 midi keyboard.  Clickable borders, midi's... absolutely nothing main stream here.  
I'll get to see how Git works with this anyways.
