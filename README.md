Simon using JS clickable borders

Despite the awesomely terrible first commit desription, playing a midi file works.  It just isn't fluid enough for my purposes.  
The clickable borders I might expand into a general purpose tool and that's got it start here as well.  
This is more just trying to get some practice with Git as embarassing as this is.  
I'm glad Git Hub made this new repo idiotproof.  
My plans for this is still use the midi but find somehow to do a 'note'.  So once this is done; I'll have the ability to build 
a midi keyboard.  2017 midi keyboard.  Clickable borders, midi's... absolutely nothing main stream here.  
I'll get to see how Git works with this anyways.
I trashed the Midi.  It wasn't old school midi that would have been like zero weight.  It was more just mapping music sounds to notes and those notes were stored as MP3 files.  It added so much weight that it made portable unusuable.  I did use the MP3 files and just directly mapped to the 'buttons'; seems to be working fine.  I might have to do some type of preload when not local but the audio files are really small so might not need it.
